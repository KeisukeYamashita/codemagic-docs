title: Perfecto integration
description: How to integrate your workflows with Perfecto using codemagic.yaml
weight: 13
---

**Perfecto** is a web-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that allows mobile application developers and QA Engineers to work with services such as advanced automation, monitoring and testing services. It is possible to integrate with Perfecto directly from your **codemagic.yaml**

Signing up with [Perfecto](https://www.perfecto.io/) is required in order to get credentials that are needed during an upload process. 

Usin the following cURL script in a pre-build script(a script that is run after executing build commands in yaml), **.apk**, **.aab** and **.ipa** binaries can be uploaded to the Perfecto platform:

```
curl "https://web.app.perfectomobile.com/repository/api/v1/artifacts" -H "Perfecto-Authorization: $PERFECTO_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "requestPart={\"artifactLocator\":\"PRIVATE:app.aab\",\"artifactType\":\"ANDROID\",\"override\":true}" -F "inputStream=@/path/to/app.aab"
```

**PERFECTO_TOKEN** can found in the Perfecto UI with your account. Environment variables can be added in the Codemagic web app using the ‘Environment variables’ tab. You can then and import your variable groups into your codemagic.yaml. For example, if you named your variable group ‘browserstack_credentials’, you would import it as follows:

```
workflows:
  workflow-name:
    environment:
      groups:
        - perfecto_credentials
```

For further information about using variable groups please click [here](.../variables/environment-variable-groups/).


## Test Automation

In order to automate tests, desired capabilities can be set inside your custom made test scripts in your project. For example, if your application requires device sensors such as camera or fingerprint reader, then **sensorInstrument** needs to be set:

```
capabilities.setCapability("sensorInstrument", true);
```

With Appium tests **autoInstrument** capability automatically instrument the application and it needs to be set to true:

```
capabilities.setCapability("autoInstrument", true);
```

## Flutter apps integration

**Android apps**

In order to set up integration for Flutter specific apps the following steps must be followed:

1. Generate a folder named **PerfectoRunAndroid** (can be named differently) in the root directory of your project.

2. Moving into **PerfectoRunAndroid** directory and initiate Gradle by executing the following commands in your local terminal:
```
cd PerfectoRun 
gradle init 
./gradlew wrapper
```
3. Running these commands will create the necessary gradle files along with an empty **build.gradle** and its content needs to be adjusted as follows:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://repo1.perfectomobile.com/public/repositories/maven/"      
        }
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.perfectomobile.instrumentedtest.gradleplugin:plugin:+"
           
        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}
// Apply the plugin 
apply plugin: 'com.perfectomobile.instrumentedtest.gradleplugin'
perfectoGradleSettings {
    configFileLocation "ConfigFile.json"
}
    task clean(type: Delete) {
        delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

3. Create a file called **ConfigFile.json** and add the following Json content in there:

```
{
      "cloudURL": "web-fra.perfectomobile.com",
      "securityToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "devices": [
       
            {
              "platformName" : "Android",
              "platformVersion": "^12.*”,
              “description”:”free”
            },
            {
              "platformName_" : "Android",
              "platformVersion_": "^11.*”,
              “description”:”free”
            }
      ],
      "jobName": "some_job",
      "jobNumber": 1,
      "branch": "some_branch",
      "projectName": "My_Flutter_project",
      "projectVersion": "v1.0",
      "tags": [
        "espresso", "plugin"  ],
      "apkPath": "YOUR_APK_PATH",
      "testApkPath": "YOUR_TEST_APK_PATH",
      "installationDetails" : {"preCleanUp" : "true"},
      "postExecution" : {"uninstall" : "false" },
      "debug": false,
      "failBuildOnFailure": false,
      "takeScreenshotOnTestFailure": true,
      "shard": false,
      "testTimeout" : 60000
    }
```

**"securityToken"** contains your Perfecto Token that can be fetched from your Perfecto account.

In order to generate **testBuildType** which refers to **testApkPath**, the following command needs to be run in a pre-build script (a script that is run after executing build commands) inside **codemagic.yaml**:

```
- name: Build Android Test release
  script: |
      ./gradlew assembleAndroidTest
```
5. As a last step, to successfully upload files and enable test automation, the following commands needs to be executed:

```
- name: Upload files to Perfecto and run tests
  script: |
      cd PerfectoRunAndroid
      ./gradlew perfecto-android-inst
```

**iOS apps**

Flutter iOS apps take almost the step steps as android builds:

1. Create another folder in the root directory named **PerfectoRunIos** (can be named differently)
2. Manually create **build.gradle** along with the following cconten:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
            maven {
                url "https://repo1.perfectomobile.com/public/repositories/maven"        
            }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.perfectomobile.instrumentedtest.gradleplugin:plugin:+"    
    }
}
apply plugin: 'com.perfectomobile.instrumentedtest.gradleplugin'
perfectoGradleSettings {
    configFileLocation "configFile.json"}
```
3. Create **configFile.json** and add the following content in there:
```
{
    "cloudURL": "beta.perfectomobile.com",
    "securityToken":"xxxxxxxxxxxx",
   
	
	"appPath":"repository:PATH_TO_IPA",
	"hostedTestModuleName":"RunnerTests",
	"isHostedTestModule":true,
	
	
	"devices": [
			{"deviceName":"00008020-000D2CC42ED8002E"},
			{"deviceName":"00008101-000B05283081401E"}
	],
	"shard": false,
	"jobName": "Flutter_iOS_Job",
  	"jobNumber": 1,
  	"branch": "Flutter_Branch",
  	"projectName": "My_Flutter_iOS_Project",
  	"projectVersion": "v1.0",
  	"tags": [
    "XCUI", "plugin"  ],
	"takeScreenshotOnTestFailure": false,
	"takeScreenshotOnTestEnd": false,
	"takeScreenshotOnTestStep": false,
	"runUITests":true,
	"runUnitTests":false,
	"installationDetails": {
		"resign": true
	  },
	  
  	"numOfDevices": 2
  }
```
4. In order to successfully upload files and enable test automation, the following commands needs to be executed:

```
- name: Upload iOS files to Perfecto and run tests
  script: |
      cd PerfectoRunIos
      gradle perfecto-xctest
```
